# time2buy: Using Genetic Algorithm to Optimize Trading  

**Objective:** Compare the performance and accuracy of genetic algorithms on historical stock market data.

So far we have researched potential APIs to help us obtain stock market historical data, as well as Python packages to aid us in implementing our genetic algorithm.

**Language:** Python 3.5

**Other resources:** Genetic Algorithm Package, Stock API 

**Team members:**

## Installation of necessary libraries

pip install geneticalgorithm

pip install numpy 

pip install scipy 

pip install matplotlib 

pip install ipython 

pip install jupyter 

pip install pandas 

pip install sympy 

pip install nose

pip install PyPortfolioOpt

pip install seaborn

## How to run the code

In order to run the code, the 4 py files beginning with algorithm will produce the weights we used
in our Genetic Algorithm. In plotting.py, the plots in our writeup are created.
